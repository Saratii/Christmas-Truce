<h2>Introduction</h2>
<hr />
<p>
   During the Christmas of 1914, German and British soldiers met in the middle of combat to celebrate the Christmas
   season by singing Christmas Carols, exchanging gifts, building Christmas Trees, and even playing soccer on the
   Western front of France after a ceasefire was called. Because the soldiers of WWI were able to make peace with the
   people that they were mid-war with during the Christmas of 1914, shows that the will of the soldiers is greater
   than that of the governments and militaries because the soldiers were able to compromise amid conflict but the
   governments could not. The comradery between soldiers of opposite sides proves that soldiers believed in more than
   just killing.

<h2>Background</h2>

</html>
<hr>
<div class="rightText">
   <img src="map.png" ; height=300px; width=300px;>
   <p>
      In the first year of World War I, Germany attempted to invade France and several other countries. Following the
      first
      Battle of the Marne, where Britain and France led an offensive against the invading German troops, French and
      British
      forces were positioned on the western border of France during the winter of 1914. On the 24th and 25th of
      December,
      1914, a ceasefire was called to let soldiers engage in Festive Activities for one night. Little did the
      governments
      know that soldiers would enter dead man's land (the area between trenches) and meet with the enemies to play
      games,
      exchange gifts, and sing Christmas carols.
   </p>
</div>
<h2>Main Event</h2>
<hr />
<p>The Christmas Truce was when several different military operations along the French border
   sang Christmas carols while in the trenches. Some soldiers even built makeshift Christmas trees and put them above
   the Trench. Very few shots were fired on the night of the 24th. On the day of Christmas, soldiers emerged from the
   Trenches on both sides and met in no man's land (the area between trenches) to participate in activities together.
   German Soldiers were the first ones to leave the trench and enter no man's land while saying "Merry Christmas" to the
   enemy. Pope Benedict XV's speech asking European powers “that the guns may fall silent at least upon the night the
   angels sang.” was a main causes for the Truce. Although there was no official ceasefire sanctioned by any of the
   countries, there was a mutual agreement between soldiers that they would not kill on Christmas during 1914. Another
   leading cause of the Truce was the German Emperor, William II, sending small Christmas Trees to the front lines of
   the German forces to boost morale during a time of suffering. One of the most famous activities showing peace was
   when soldiers on both sides met to play soccer with a makeshift ball. The way that the soldiers disrequard the orders
   of their superiors and even their countries in order to have a day of peace is important because it shows that the
   war was more than just blood shed. The soldiers found similarities with even those that were shooting at them the
   previous day. The soldiers also proved that they are in control of themselves and not blindlessly attacking based on
   orders from their officers. The short period of peace also allowed for soldiers of both sides to collect dead bodies
   that were previously unobtainable because they were in no man's land to give them a proper burial. Contrary to
   popular belief imposed by propaganda in newspapers following the Truce, the Germans were the ones to actually
   initiate the truce by singing Christmas Carols such as Silent Night, and entered no man's land unarmed. </p>

   <p>This primary photo was a photo taken on Christmas Eve of 1914. The photo shows how the
      soldiers were celebrating Christas while at war, inside the trenches. It shows makeshift Christmas trees being
      built
      by the soldiers, and soldiers singing Christmas Carols together. This primary photo is important because it proves
      what was actually happening during Christmas in 1914 by showing that it was peaceful for a short period of time
      where
      soldiers were not armed and not shooting their weapons.</p>

      played soccer on Christmas day and in fact he was one of them. It shows that the soldiers were proud of the fact
      that
      they made peace and shows that they were playing with the German soldiers between the two trenches.</p>

<h2> Short Term Impacts</h2>
<hr />
<p>The most important short term impact following the truce was a chain of truces on
   Christmas in the years following even though it was frowned upon. Although there are few documented cases of opposing
   soldiers communicating or getting together during Christmas like that of 1914, a ceasefire on Christmas eve and
   Christmas day so that soldiers could celebrate Christmas on their own was a common occurrence after 1914 to the end
   of the war. Another short term impact was showing the public and the media that the soldiers could make peace with
   Germans. Following the Truce, superior officers and generals on both sides were unhappy that the truce occurred. They
   made it known that there should not be any more truces called by soldiers on the battlefield. This was seen as a
   heartless statement because the generals and commanders were perfectly safe where they were, and they should view the
   soldiers as people instead of casualties. This started a minor backlash towards both militaries. Disregarding the
   orders to not pause the fighting led to at least one documented case of a soldier being court martialed. The public
   was able to see the light in this event and the
   peaceful actions on both sides gave citizens something to have hope for amongst the horrors of WWI. </p>
<h2> Long Term Impact</h2>
<hr />
<p>Showing humanity and that peace could be obtained mid-war was the greatest lasting impact.
   The Christmas Truce would serve as an example of soldiers making peace and that the lives of the soldiers are
   important. It also showed the difference between the soldiers who risked their lives versus the commanders who saw
   the war as a game. Media, art, and movies such as Joyeux Noël (2005) have been created by people inspired by the
   overwhelming peace and humanity shown in 1914. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<hr />
<p>On December 24th, 1914, British, French, and German soldiers engaged in Christmas Activities
   during an unofficial ceasefire proving to the world that the war was not just political and that the lives of the
   soldiers out weighed the orders of the military. Humanity and comradery of German soldiers allowing them to formulate
   a peaceful encounter with the opposing side will remain one of the highlights of WWI because it gave people hope
   among a time of horror, pain, and suffering. It will be a lasting example of peace being made soldier to soldier
   amidst war. The truce also shows that the soldiers make their own decisions and are not just items to be used by the
   government. The public support of the event proved stronger than the military backlash because of the soldiers were
   proud of what they had done shown by the art art, photos, and statements made by soldiers during and following the
   event. The Christmas Truce shows that soldiers on complete opposite sides have common interests and can work together
   to create a short moment of peace even when they were mercilessly killing each other just one day before. </p>
