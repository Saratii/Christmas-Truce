            A letter sent by one of the soldiers shot during the Christmas Truce. The letter was sent to his mother from
            the trenches. It is a primary source because it was created during the Christmas Truce. It will be used as a
            primary document to represent the soldier's feelings during the Christmas season.

            This source provides maps showing where the truce happened. This is important in order to give context about
            the event. The source also has several primary sources consisting of newspapers, pictures, and artwork. The
            most important document from the source is the map showing German boundaries during late 1914.</p>

            Another summary of the truce. This source is focused on the Christmas events that took place during the
            truce such as singing, gift exchanging, and playing games. It will be a great source to use for the main

            This source shows the effects of the Christmas Truce that lasted throughout the entire war. Even though
            there were no more Christmas Truces, some of the activities that were participated in during the Christmas
            Truce were done yearly throughout the war. It also features several primary pictures and documents. The
            source will be used in showing the causes and effects, specifically effects, that the Christmas Truce had.

            Another great primary source, this source was an illustration of the events that took place during the
            Christmas Truce. The original illustration was published in a newspaper all across London on Jan 9th 1915, a
            few days after the Christmas Truce. The illustration features British and German soldiers meeting in "No
            Man's Land" to celebrate Christmas. The source will be included as a primary source in the project and used
            to represent how Christmas brought peace to soldiers mid war for a short time.</p>

            Accessed 28 Oct. 2021.<br>
            This source shows the personal effect on the soldiers the truce had. Because creating a temporary truce was
            against officer's orders, some soldiers were sent to court martial. The source will be used to give other
            background information that was not found on any of the other sources.</p>

            From Britannica, the source is a collection of facts and a recollection of the Christmas Truce. As the
            source is not as in depth as some of the other sources, it will mainly be used to fact check and verify
            information. The site also has links to several great primary sources.

            This source goes into extreme depth into the topic. It has many image primary sources, written primary
            sources. It uses a timeline over a few days to show all of the information. It gives a day by day in depth

            "football" being played by British and German Troops on Christmas. This source will be used to contribute to

            A useful source because it provides a unique opinion about why we should not praise and romanticize the
            truce. It is unique because all of the other sources make it out to be a great event and moment of peace.
            This source will contribute greatly to my project by helping to remove bias.</p>

            The source is a primary source. It features a photograph taken during the Christmas Truce. It shows German
